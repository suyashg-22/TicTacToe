# 🎮 TicTacToe

Hi! I'm Suyash Ghilahare, and this is a simple **Tic Tac Toe** web game that I built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
It's a fun 2-player game with a clean UI and basic game mechanics like detecting the winner or a draw.
I created this project to improve my front-end skills and learn more about DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.

## 🎯 Game Instructions

1. The game is for two players: one plays with **X** and the other with **O**.
2. Players take turns to click on the grid.
3. The first player to get 3 marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
4. If all 9 boxes are filled and no player has won, it's a draw.
5. You can use the **Reset** button to restart anytime, or **New Game** after a result.

## 🖼️ UI Theme

The game uses a dark grey-black theme with warm brown and pastel tones to give it a modern and soft look.
